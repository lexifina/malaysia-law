Federal Constitution
- v0 2020-10-15: the Reprint "As at 15 October 2020" (first_law null, oldest version available). That reprint
  already prints the words of Act A1603 section 3 (Article 119) although they were not yet in force; its own
  footnotes give the words they replaced, which are put back for this version (FIX_2020).
- Then each amending Act in force after 15 October 2020, on the day the 2025 Reprint's NOTES give, with the
  provisions those NOTES name; the text each Act gave is the 2025 Reprint's text of that provision. Where two Acts
  changed one Article on different days (Article 160), the intermediate text is the 2025 text without what the
  later Act inserted (INTERMEDIATE), as the NOTES describe it.
- Last version 2025-11-30: the Reprint "As at 30 November 2025", as printed. Any remaining difference from the
  version before is a change no Act explains (publisher, unexplained); parse.py stops if one is unexpected.
- Provisions whose words are identical in both reprints take the 2025 line breaks in every version, so a
  different reading of paragraph breaks is never reported as a change.
